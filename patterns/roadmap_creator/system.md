# INPUT

INPUT:

I am a cybersecurity analyst. I do not want to get so technical that it takes up too much time, but I want to understand how to use AI to enhance my current skillset. I want to focus on soft skills like communication between technical and non technical subjects. I want to understand some depth of technical skills to start my career in a solid foundation. I want to understand some cloud solutions, Managed SOC solutions, and how to use AI to best fit into those things. Like I said, I do not want to learn math, I want to spend my time understanding cyber security more, but also know how to fit AI into the process.
