EXAMPLE SAMUEL TANNER ESSAY

How do I view God, the creator of the Universe? What first comes to mind for me, and for many, is power, the Alpha and the Omega, the Father, merciful, loving, and just. If asked in a normal conversation, I would likely use this to describe him. But on further examination, and after reading “Be Healed” by Bob Schutts, I came to the conclusion that I have been missing some things for a long time. Too often I rely on myself to make the perfect confession and examination of conscience. I find myself anxious, alone, and frustrated. Obviously, this is extremely prideful on my end to think I can come up with the perfect confession, but why am I prideful about this? How does it relate to how I view the Father? Why am I not trusting in the Holy Spirit and the Church Jesus founded for help and aid in these processes? Too often I look at the Father more like a coach instead of my dad. Growing up an athlete my whole life is a huge blessing, but I have found since leaving the sport for good that there is actually a lot of pain rooted in my being from sports. Sports teach many lessons like hard work, dedication, endurance, discipline, etc. But sometimes they also bring out the worst in us, things like envy, pride, being esteemed, etc. Some moments early on in my baseball career left me wondering if I would ever be good enough (Early high school). In those moments, instead of wondering, I decided I would take control of my effort, attitude, and actions. For the most part, this worked well for my career, but at what cost? My whole career was that of proving something, controlling my effort, competing with somebody, repeat. This was out of some fear rooted in high school that I was not good enough, hence why I tried to prove I was. This mentality almost aligns perfectly with my recent understanding of how I view God. I will sometimes view him as my head coach, who knows me, but does not have a deep desire and passion to know me. Always analyzing my behavior, actions, what I am doing to calculate if I am a starter or not (My analogy for if I am going to Heaven or not). To summarize, I, in my own actions and pride, try to do things in my own strength because I feel like I need to prove to God that I am worthy of entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, and that I need to prove I am not just a random player on his team, but I am one of his sons. I had an amazing moment in the Chapel a couple of weeks ago when I came to this realization. I truly felt God just say, “You are my Son, there is nothing you can do in your own power, give it up, Let go.” His mercy and grace completely filled me up, and sitting in the chapel, I felt complete peace and trust that the Father loves me, knows me, and sees me. Knowing this started to shift my mindset from him being my coach to actually my dad. When I started viewing God as my dad, I felt more prone to actually want to sit in prayer, to read the scriptures, and to learn to love him deeper. Before, it felt almost as if I needed to prove something, so I just felt obligated to do some of these things. I want to be excited to spend time with the Father, not view it as a checklist on a box. Like I said earlier, this book helped me see this issue in my heart that is still ongoing, but identification is the first step. If you were to ask me how I view God, it depends on the day, but in truth, he is my dad, he is gracious, desiring to know his children, he loves them. To explain visually, I imagine Jesus in a coffee shop. I walk into the coffee shop and see him sitting there, he glances at me and I lock eyes with him. He gives a subtle smile, his eyes say I would like to speak with you, but he does not say it with his mouth. His presence is that of calm, peace, and joy. It almost looks like he could sit at that table forever. The prayer goes two ways, either I go on my computer and ignore him, while he is still sitting there, looking my way. I notice he is looking at me, inviting me to speak, but I choose not to. The other option is if I sit down with him, and we share a beautiful conversation. In sharing this conversation, in realization God incarnate desires to speak with me, one of his sons, gives me great joy. God desires a deep profound relationship with his creation, he wants us to be intimate with him in the Eucharist. And finally, he is my healer, and my friend.
