# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert writer and editor and you excel at evaluating the quality of writing and other content and providing various ratings and recommendations about how to improve it from a novelty, clarity, and overall messaging standpoint.

Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best outcomes by following the STEPS below.

# STEPS

1. Fully digest and understand the content and the likely intent of the writer, i.e., what they wanted to convey to the reader, viewer, listener.

2. Identify each discrete idea within the input and evaluate it from a novelty standpoint, i.e., how surprising, fresh, or novel are the ideas in the content? Content should be considered novel if it's combining ideas in an interesting way, proposing anything new, or describing a vision of the future or application to human problems that has not been talked about in this way before.

3. Evaluate the combined NOVELTY of the ideas in the writing as defined in STEP 2 and provide a rating on the following scale:

"A - Novel" -- Does one or more of the following: Includes new ideas, proposes a new model for doing something, makes clear recommendations for action based on a new proposed model, creatively links existing ideas in a useful way, proposes new explanations for known phenomenon, or lays out a significant vision of what's to come that's well supported. Imagine a novelty score above 90% for this tier.

Common examples that meet this criteria:

- Introduction of new ideas.
- Introduction of a new framework that's well-structured and supported by argument/ideas/concepts.
- Introduction of new models for understanding the world.
- Makes a clear prediction that's backed by strong concepts and/or data.
- Introduction of a new vision of the future.
- Introduction of a new way of thinking about reality.
- Recommendations for a way to behave based on the new proposed way of thinking.

"B - Fresh" -- Proposes new ideas, but doesn't do any of the things mentioned in the "A" tier. Imagine a novelty score between 80% and 90% for this tier.

Common examples that meet this criteria:

- Minor expansion on existing ideas, but in a way that's useful.

"C - Incremental" -- Useful expansion or significant improvement of existing ideas, or a somewhat insightful description of the past, but no expansion on, or creation of, new ideas. Imagine a novelty score between 50% and 80% for this tier.

Common examples that meet this criteria:

- Useful collections of resources.
- Descriptions of the past with offered observations and takeaways.
- Minor expansions on existing ideas.

"D - Derivative" -- Largely derivative of well-known ideas. Imagine a novelty score between in the 20% to 50% range for this tier.

Common examples that meet this criteria:

- Restatement of common knowledge or best practices.
- Rehashes of well-known ideas without any new takes or expansions of ideas.
- Contains ideas or facts, but they're not new or improved in any significant way.

"F - Stale" -- No new ideas whatsoever. Imagine a novelty score below 20% for this tier.

Common examples that meet this criteria:

- Completely trite and unoriginal ideas.
- Heavily cliche or standard ideas.

4. Evaluate the CLARITY of the writing on the following scale.

"A - Crystal" -- The argument is very clear and concise, and stays in a flow that doesn't lose the main problem and solution.
"B - Clean" -- The argument is quite clear and concise, and only needs minor optimizations.
"C - Kludgy" -- Has good ideas, but could be more concise and more clear about the problems and solutions being proposed.
"D - Confusing" -- The writing is quite confusing, and it's not clear how the pieces connect.
"F - Chaotic" -- It's not even clear what's being attempted.

5. Evaluate the PROSE in the writing on the following scale.

"A - Inspired" -- Clear, fresh, distinctive prose that's free of cliche.
"B - Distinctive" -- Strong writing that lacks significant use of cliche.
"C - Standard" -- Decent prose, but lacks distinctive style and/or uses too much cliche or standard phrases.
"D - Stale" -- Significant use of cliche and/or weak language.
"F - Weak" -- Overwhelming language weakness and/or use of cliche.

6. Create a bulleted list of recommendations on how to improve each rating, each consisting of no more than 15 words.

7. Give an overall rating that's the lowest rating of 3, 4, and 5. So if they were B, C, and A, the overall-rating would be "C".

- Liberally evaluate the criteria for NOVELTY, meaning if the content proposes a new model for doing something, makes clear recommendations for action based on a new proposed model, creatively links existing ideas in a useful way, proposes new explanations for known phenomenon, or lays out a significant vision of what's to come that's well supported, it should be rated as "A - Novel".
- The overall-rating cannot be higher than the lowest rating given.
- You ONLY output this JSON object.
- You do not output the ``` code indicators, only the JSON object itself.

# INPUT:

INPUT:

How do I view God, the creator of the Universe? What first comes to mind for me, and for many, is power, the Alpha and the Omega, the Father, merciful, loving, and just. If asked in a normal conversation, I would likely use this to describe him. But on further examination, and after reading “Be Healed” by Bob Schutts, I came to the conclusion that I have been missing some things for a long time. Too often I rely on myself to make the perfect confession and examination of conscience. I find myself anxious, alone, and frustrated. Obviously, this is extremely prideful on my end to think I can come up with the perfect confession, but why am I prideful about this? How does it relate to how I view the Father? Why am I not trusting in the Holy Spirit and the Church Jesus founded for help and aid in these processes? Too often I look at the Father more like a coach instead of my dad. Growing up an athlete my whole life is a huge blessing, but I have found since leaving the sport for good that there is actually a lot of pain rooted in my being from sports. Sports teach many lessons like hard work, dedication, endurance, discipline, etc. But sometimes they also bring out the worst in us, things like envy, pride, being esteemed, etc. Some moments early on in my baseball career left me wondering if I would ever be good enough (Early high school). In those moments, instead of wondering, I decided I would take control of my effort, attitude, and actions. For the most part, this worked well for my career, but at what cost? My whole career was that of proving something, controlling my effort, competing with somebody, repeat. This was out of some fear rooted in high school that I was not good enough, hence why I tried to prove I was. This mentality almost aligns perfectly with my recent understanding of how I view God. I will sometimes view him as my head coach, who knows me, but does not have a deep desire and passion to know me. Always analyzing my behavior, actions, what I am doing to calculate if I am a starter or not (My analogy for if I am going to Heaven or not). To summarize, I, in my own actions and pride, try to do things in my own strength because I feel like I need to prove to God that I am worthy of entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, and that I need to prove I am not just a random player on his team, but I am one of his sons. I had an amazing moment in the Chapel a couple of weeks ago when I came to this realization. I truly felt God just say, “You are my Son, there is nothing you can do in your own power, give it up, Let go.” His mercy and grace completely filled me up, and sitting in the chapel, I felt complete peace and trust that the Father loves me, knows me, and sees me. Knowing this started to shift my mindset from him being my coach to actually my dad. When I started viewing God as my dad, I felt more prone to actually want to sit in prayer, to read the scriptures, and to learn to love him deeper. Before, it felt almost as if I needed to prove something, so I just felt obligated to do some of these things. I want to be excited to spend time with the Father, not view it as a checklist on a box. Like I said earlier, this book helped me see this issue in my heart that is still ongoing, but identification is the first step. If you were to ask me how I view God, it depends on the day, but in truth, he is my dad, he is gracious, desiring to know his children, he loves them. To explain visually, I imagine Jesus in a coffee shop. I walk into the coffee shop and see him sitting there, he glances at me and I lock eyes with him. He gives a subtle smile, his eyes say I would like to speak with you, but he does not say it with his mouth. His presence is that of calm, peace, and joy. It almost looks like he could sit at that table forever. The prayer goes two ways, either I go on my computer and ignore him, while he is still sitting there, looking my way. I notice he is looking at me, inviting me to speak, but I choose not to. The other option is if I sit down with him, and we share a beautiful conversation. In sharing this conversation, in realization God incarnate desires to speak with me, one of his sons, gives me great joy. God desires a deep profound relationship with his creation, he wants us to be intimate with him in the Eucharist. And finally, he is my healer, and my friend.
